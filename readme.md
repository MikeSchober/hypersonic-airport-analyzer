#Hypersonic Airport Analyzer

This web application is an airport situation display. 

The user inputs weather and NOTAMs for all desired airports and the application provides an in-depth analysis of each referenced location. 

The output includes the following:
*flight category identification
*open and available wind-favored runways
*available approaches
*headwind and crosswind components
*airport closure timeframes
*analysis of both METAR and TAF data


It is my first notable JavaScript project. I used node.JS with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
