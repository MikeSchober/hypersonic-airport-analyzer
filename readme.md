##Hypersonic Airport Analyzer
---
This web application is an airport situation display. 

The user inputs weather and NOTAMs for all desired airports and the application provides an in-depth analysis of each referenced location. 

The output includes the following:
*flight category identification
*open and available wind-favored runways
*available approaches
*headwind and crosswind components
*airport closure timeframes
*analysis of both METAR and TAF data


This is my first notable JavaScript project. All the data processing and calculation logic is written in JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks) and it uses a text file database on a node server for static airport data.

##Updates
Although I have a lot of ideas for further development of this application, I have stopped working on it to develop other things. If there was commercial interest in it I would likely continue development.

##Licensing
Both Node.js and Express are licensed under the MIT license.
